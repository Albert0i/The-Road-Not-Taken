#### Prologue 
The day when tools you used for decades no longer serve you but the cooperation. The day when intrusive AI comes in company with you on treading every flagstones. I shudder in sweat as if I were naked... Shit! This is wrong, this is *all* wrong... 


#### I. The Dawn
In January of 2026, three Linux distros have been evaluated: 
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
- [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/)
- [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)

The last one is chosen not because other two are not good. It's a sensibility issue, nothing to do with functionality. 

Zorin OS comes with all the essential apps you need out of the box, so you can get working right away. Discover thousands of powerful apps from the built-in [Software store](https://help.zorin.com/docs/apps-games/install-apps/#software-store). 

- [Alternatives to Windows Apps](https://help.zorin.com/docs/apps-games/alternatives-to-windows-apps/)
- [AlternativeTo.net](https://alternativeto.net/)

You can even run many Windows apps in Zorin OS with [Windows App Support](https://help.zorin.com/docs/apps-games/windows-app-support/).

- [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
- [Bottle](https://usebottles.com/)
- [WinBoat](https://www.winboat.app/)

Personally, I won't *recommend* using virtualization software like [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)! Keep opting out, and don’t look back.


#### II. My Windows 11 Laptop

#### III. Zorin laptop  
![alt zorin os 18](img/Screenshot%20from%202026-02-15%2019-44-08.png)

> 中文簡繁內碼轉換器 - ConvertZ，簡單易用而且功能強大的中文內碼轉換工具，支援 GBK、Big5、HZ、Shift-JIS、JIS、EUC-JP、Unicode Little Endian、Unicode Big Endian、及 UTF-8 編碼，讓您輕鬆的對純文字檔案、檔案/資料夾名稱、剪貼簿文字、及 MP3 ID3 標籤在上述編碼之間進行轉換。

![alt ConvertZ](img/ConvertZ.JPG)

1. [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/)

2. [Bottles - Run Windows Software on Linux](https://usebottles.com/)

**Use case 2**: [ASS2SRT](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p6zjkkntck1?hl=en-US&gl=SA) 
> A small tool designed specifically for Windows users to convert between ASS subtitles and SRT subtitles requires the installation of the. NET Desktop Runtime to function properly. This APP is available for free trial for 7 days. After that, you will need to pay to

![alt ASS2SRT](img/ASS2SRT.JPG)

SubShifter - Online SRT Subtitle Resync Tool
https://subshifter.bitsnbites.eu/


**Use case 3**: [Garmin Express](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/software/express/windows/)
> Use Garmin Express to update maps and software, sync with Garmin Connect and register your device. This desktop software notifies you when updates are available and helps you install them.

**System Requirements**

- Windows 10 or newer, Microsoft .NET 4.7.2 (included)
- 1024 x 768 display, USB port and 1 GB RAM
- High-speed internet access (not for use with dial-up, mobile or satellite connections)
- May require up to 20 GB free disk space
- For users running Windows 8 or older, please [download version 7 of Garmin Express for Windows](https://download.garmin.com/omt/express/GarminExpressWin7.exe).

[WineHQ AppDB](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=17447)
[Garmin Express](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=40213)

Installation instructions
```
The installation is quite basic. Download the installer with the links provided, e.g. to /tmp. Then proceed to create a new prefix somewhere your user has write permissions to, e.g. in /opt/garmin/:

mkdir -p /opt/garmin/ && cd /opt/garmin/
export WINEPREFIX=/opt/garmin/
wineboot -i
Install the .NET Framework 4.7.2 in there. --force is needed to prevent winetricks from not completing installation because some of the dotnet verbs may be broken:

winetricks --force dotnet472
Now execute GarminExpress.exe in there.

wine /tmp/GarminExpress.exe
That's about it, really. I additionally went into the settings and disabled launch on "boot" to remove possible complications this may cause, if any.

To simplify launching you can create a .desktop file and place it into /usr/share/applications/ to be able to launch it with your DE. Otherwise, export the wineprefix and launch:

wine "/opt/garmin/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Garmin/Express/express.exe"
```

**Use case 4**: [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/)
> The latest entertainment apps now come installed with the latest macOS. Upgrade today to get your favorite music, movies, TV shows, and podcasts. You can join Apple Music and stream — or download and play offline — millions of songs, ad‑free.

Wine for older software and simple program.

Running a dual-boot system or linux with virtual box is a technical compromise solution, which are inconvenient for daily use, and so does WinBoat. Stress on integration instead of virtualization. 

Windows subsystem for Linux running on a docker virtual machine. 

Integration instead of emulation. Run a full-fledged Windows VM. 
Not specifically innovative but a composite of multiple mature techniques. 

Pros: 100% compability. Anything can be run on a VM and can be run on WinBoat in theory. 

FreeRDP combine remote windows protocol. 

Cons: Still in beta, not rock solid. Multiple prerequisites and huge resource consumption, less performant. No GPU acceleration pass-through for the time being. 

**Caveat**: 

1. It is illegal to use unactivated version of Windows;
2. Microsoft does allow install and use unactivated version of Windows for evaluation and temporary use but not for day-to-day long term use;
3. Use of unactivated version of Windows may incur lawsuit and punishment but not for home use.

#### IV. Chromebook 
![alt chromebook-desktop](img/chromebook-desktop.png)

![alt chromebook](img/Chromebook%202026-02-19%203.23.43%20PM.png)

Intel(R) Core(TM) m3-8100Y CPU @ 1.10GHz
> The Intel Core m3-8100Y is an ultra-low-power, 8th-generation dual-core processor designed for thin-and-light laptops, 2-in-1s, and tablets. Operating at a base frequency of 1.10 GHz, it boasts a turbo boost up to 3.40 GHz. It is ideal for basic productivity tasks, with a very low 5W TDP, and features Intel UHD Graphics 615.

Key Specifications & Performance:

- Cores/Threads: 2 cores / 4 threads (Hyper-Threading).
- Frequency: 1.10 GHz Base, 3.40 GHz Turbo.
- Graphics: Integrated Intel® UHD Graphics 615.
- TDP: 5W (extremely energy-efficient).
- Cache: 4 MB Intel® Smart Cache.
- Use Case: Ideal for light browsing, document editing, and mobility rather than heavy processing.

> The m3-8100Y is often found in devices like the Microsoft Surface Go 2 and various ASUS Chromebooks. It offers decent performance for daily tasks but is not meant for gaming or intense video editing. 

> Crostini is the official method for running Linux applications directly on ChromeOS, offering a secure, containerized Debian-based environment. It enables developers and users to install IDEs, editors, and terminal tools, which integrate seamlessly into the Launcher and share files with the host system. It is supported on most modern Chromebooks via the settings menu.

> To install Docker on a Chromebook, you must use the built-in Linux development environment (Crostini) and follow the standard Docker Engine installation steps for Debian Linux. Docker Desktop for Linux may not run correctly in the Crostini environment.

**1. Update the apt package index and install necessary prerequisites**
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common -y
```

**2. Add Docker's official GPG key**
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

**3. Set up the stable Docker repository for your architecture (usually amd64 or arm64, depending on your Chromebook's CPU)**:
```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

**4. Install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd**

The Road Not Taken
By Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,    兩條路在黃葉林中分歧， 
And sorry I could not travel both.      可嘆我無法兩者都挑。
And be one traveler, long I stood       單身行路的我久久佇立，
And looked down one as far as I could   向其中一條極目望去，
To where it bent in the undergrowth;    直看到被林木掩住的轉角。
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,   然後我走了另一條路，一樣美麗，
And having perhaps the better claim,    而且還或許更加合宜，
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  因爲它青草萋萋看似乏人問津；
Though as for that the passing there    雖説兩條路上行人來去，
Had worn them really about the same,    踩踏的程度其實相差無幾。
 
And both that morning equally lay       當天早上兩條路同樣被落葉覆蓋，
In leaves no step had trodden black.    沒有黑色的足跡沾染。
Oh, I kept the first for another day!   啊，頭一條路留待改日再來！

I shall be telling this with a sigh     很多很多年以後在某處，
Somewhere ages and ages hence:          我會嘆息著將此事提起：
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—    森林中的路分岔成兩條，而我 –
I took the one less traveled by,        我選了較少人走的那條路，
And that has made all the difference.   於是再來的一切都迴然相異。
