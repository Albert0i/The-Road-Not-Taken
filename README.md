#### Prologue 
The day when tools you used for several decades no longer serve you but the cooperation. The day when intrusive AI comes in company with you while treading every flagstones. I just can't shake it off... I shudder in sweat as if I were naked.... Hey! This is wrong, this is *all* wrong... 


#### I. The Dawn
In January of 2026, three Linux distros have been evaluated: 
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
- [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/)
- [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)

The last one is chosen not because other two are bad. It's a sensibility issue, nothing to do with functionality. The free version of Zorin OS is bundled with lots of software. In case, your favourite one is not present, try to find alternatives: 

- [Alternatives to Windows Apps](https://help.zorin.com/docs/apps-games/alternatives-to-windows-apps/)
- [AlternativeTo.net](https://alternativeto.net/)

- [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/)
- [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/snapd)

In case, no alternative, try to run them with: 

- [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
- [Bottle](https://usebottles.com/)
- [WinBoat](https://www.winboat.app/)

Personally, I won't recommend using virtualization software like [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) because it drags you back and we need to opt out...

The Road Not Taken
By Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
```
