#### Prologue 
The day when tools you used for several decades no longer serve you but the cooperation. The day when intrusive AI comes in company with you while treading every flagstones. I just can't shake it off... I shudder in sweat as if I were naked.... Hey! This is wrong, this is *all* wrong... 


#### I. The Dawn
In January of 2026, three Linux distros have been evaluated: 
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
- [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/)
- [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)

The last one is chosen not because other two are bad. It's a sensibility issue, nothing to do with functionality. 

Zorin OS 18 bundles in its migration guide for Windows users:

📌 Zorin OS 18 highlights these alternatives to make migration smoother, with many of them pre‑installed or available directly from the Zorin Software store.  

In case, your favourite one is not present, try to find alternatives on: 

- [Alternatives to Windows Apps](https://help.zorin.com/docs/apps-games/alternatives-to-windows-apps/)
- [AlternativeTo.net](https://alternativeto.net/)

In case, no alternative found, try to run them with: 

- [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
- [Bottle](https://usebottles.com/)
- [WinBoat](https://www.winboat.app/)

Personally, I won't recommend using virtualization software like [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)! Don't look back, we are going to opt out...

The Road Not Taken
By Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,    兩條路在黃葉林中分歧， 
And sorry I could not travel both.      可嘆我無法兩者都挑。
And be one traveler, long I stood       單身行路的我久久佇立，
And looked down one as far as I could   向其中一條極目望去，
To where it bent in the undergrowth;    直看到被林木掩住的轉角。
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,   然後我走了另一條路，一樣美麗，
And having perhaps the better claim,    而且還或許更加合宜，
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  因爲它青草萋萋看似乏人問津；
Though as for that the passing there    雖説兩條路上行人來去，
Had worn them really about the same,    踩踏的程度其實相差無幾。
 
And both that morning equally lay       當天早上兩條路同樣被落葉覆蓋，
In leaves no step had trodden black.    沒有黑色的足跡沾染。
Oh, I kept the first for another day!   啊，頭一條路留待改日再來！

I shall be telling this with a sigh     很多很多年以後在某處，
Somewhere ages and ages hence:          我會嘆息著將此事提起：
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—    森林中的路分岔成兩條，而我 –
I took the one less traveled by,        我選了較少人走的那條路，
And that has made all the difference.   於是再來的一切都迴然相異。
