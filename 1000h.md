# Weekend Project Guide: Reviving ASUS EeePC 1000H with SSD and Lightweight Linux

This guide mirrors the length and depth of the F8Vr upgrade plan, but tailored to the **ASUS EeePC 1000H** — a netbook released in 2008 that became iconic for its portability. With careful preparation and a lightweight Linux distribution, you can give this little machine a second life.

## 🔎 ASUS EeePC 1000H Specifications
For full technical details, see the official specification listing: [ASUS EeePC 1000H](https://www.eprice.com.tw/tech/news/100/1/).  

Key highlights:
- **CPU**: Intel Atom N270 (1.6 GHz, 32‑bit only)  
- **RAM**: 1 GB DDR2 (expandable to 2 GB max)  
- **Storage**: 2.5″ SATA HDD (80–160 GB originally)  
- **Display**: 10.2″, 1024×600 resolution  
- **Connectivity**: Wi‑Fi 802.11b/g, Ethernet, Bluetooth (optional)  
- **Ports**: 3× USB 2.0, VGA, audio jacks, card reader  
- **OS (original)**: Windows XP Home

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Backup data** from the old HDD.  
2. **Download lightweight Linux ISO**:
   - Zorin OS Lite 32‑bit (if available).  
   - Alternatives: **Lubuntu 18.04 (32‑bit)**, **antiX Linux**, or **Puppy Linux**.  
3. **Create bootable USB**:
   - Use **Rufus** or **balenaEtcher**.  
   - Format as **MBR** (legacy BIOS only).  
4. **BIOS setup**:
   - Press **F2** at startup.  
   - Enable **USB boot**.  
   - Set SATA mode to **IDE** (Atom chipset often lacks AHCI).

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Hardware Upgrade
1. Power down, unplug, and remove battery.  
2. Access HDD bay underneath.  
3. Replace the old HDD with a **smaller SSD (120–240 GB recommended)**.  
   - Larger SSDs work, but the Atom CPU and 2 GB RAM limit performance.  
4. Secure SSD, replace cover, reinsert battery.

## 💻 Phase 3: OS Installation with Optimized Partitioning
Choose **“Something Else”** during installation to manually partition.

### Recommended Partition Layout
| Mount Point | Size   | Filesystem | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|------------|---------|
| `/boot`     | 512 MB | ext4       | Kernel and bootloader files. |
| `/` (root)  | 20 GB  | ext4       | OS, applications, configs. |
| `/home`     | 60 GB  | ext4       | User files, documents, settings. |
| `swap`      | 2 GB   | swap       | Matches max RAM size, supports hibernation. |
| `/data`     | Remaining | ext4    | Extra storage for files. |

### Notes
- **Swap size**: 2 GB is optimal, equal to max RAM.  
- **Filesystem**: ext4 is stable and efficient.  
- **SSD alignment**: Modern installers handle this automatically.

## ⚙️ Phase 4: Post‑Install Tweaks
1. **Update system**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. **Enable TRIM** (if supported):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
   ```
3. **Install essentials**:
   - Lightweight browser: Midori or Falkon.  
   - Office: AbiWord + Gnumeric (lighter than LibreOffice).  
   - Media: VLC or SMPlayer.  
4. **Customize desktop**:
   - Use LXDE or XFCE for speed.  
   - Disable visual effects.  

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Verification
- **Boot speed**: ~25–30 seconds with SSD.  
- **RAM usage**: ~200–300 MB idle with lightweight distro.  
- **Disk organization**: Clean separation of system and data.  

---

## Advanced Considerations
- **Dual‑boot**: Possible with Windows XP, but not recommended for security.  
- **Encryption**: Optional for `/home`, but may slow performance.  
- **Backup strategy**: Sync `/data` to USB stick or external drive.  
- **Use cases**: Perfect for note‑taking, basic browsing, or retro computing projects.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The **EeePC 1000H** is far more limited than the F8Vr, but with an SSD and a lightweight Linux distribution, it can still serve as a functional secondary machine. Think of it as a minimalist companion — ideal for distraction‑free writing, simple browsing, or retro projects.
